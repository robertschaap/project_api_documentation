# General
To make development a bit easier and mimic real life circumstances, some of the projects I've been working on that I've repeatedly used to test out different technologies have been split into separate repositories for front-end and back-end (where possible). The documentation per project notes the technologies used and API routes and responses. This ensures that any front-end repo could talk to any back-end repo. It makes any change to either a bit more painful, but the lessons learned there are exactly the point.

## Ports
- Front-end `3000`
- Back-end `4000`

## Projects Covered
- [Blog](./blogapplication.md)
- [BulletinBoard v1](./bulletinboard_v1.md)
- [BulletinBoard v2](./bulletinboard_v2.md)
- [RoyalMobile](./royalmobile.md)


## Type Notation
Routes are denoted by HTTP verb and a route string: `GET /api/myroute`. Any query parameters, request body, or anything attached to the request that needs documenting is described in a typed object-like fashion.

```typescript
type QueryParams = {
  myParam: T;
}

type Params = {
  myParam: T;
}
```

Each such object uses TypeScript notation, this fits well for the front-end and is descriptive enough for back-end uses as well. Note that this is using the notation and that the types generated by this notation are not necessarily the exact same types as implemented. In the case of API responses for example, part of the type is literal, while in the actual code something more generic would be used.
